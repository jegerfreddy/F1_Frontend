This is part 1 of my webdevelopment exam given in my third semester at Kristiania.

For this part the task was to develop a reactive frontend solution based on formula 1, where a user could search up drivers from a database and also add their own drivers to the database.

Sidenote! I also implemented a very simple game in this frontend.
